                <p>No, just a regular mistake. Why not indeed! You lived before you met me?! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
                <p>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. <strong> Fry, that doesn't make sense.</strong> <em> Wow, you got that off the Internet?</em> In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.</p>
                <h2>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</h2>
                <p>You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! No, I'm Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.</li><li>Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</li><li>You're going to do his laundry?</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</h3>
                <p>I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Shut up and take my money! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! You are the last hope of the universe.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</li><li>Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.</li><li>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</li>

                <p>You know, I was God once. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
                <p>It's a T. It goes "tuh". Oh yeah, good luck with that. Leela's gonna kill me. You can see how I lived before I met you.</p>
                <p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
                <p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</p>
                <p>When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>
                <p>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
                <p>No, she'll probably make me do it. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</p>
                <p>Kif might! Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Hey, whatcha watching? Fry, we have a crate to deliver.</p>
                <p>Who am I making this out to? It doesn't look so shiny to me. Actually, that's still true. Throw her in the brig.</p>
                <p>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Noooooo! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Soothe us with sweet lies. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!</p>
                <p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</p>
